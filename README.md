# Obico ML Home Assistant Integration
[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

HA Integration for [Obico ML REST API server addon](https://github.com/nobodyguy/obico_ml_ha_addon). This integration allows you to turn any HA Camera entity into a source for Obico's AI 3D printing failure detection.

## Features

- Automatically detects 3D printing errors by periodically sending camera images to an external detection backend.
- Configurable detection interval, threshold, and camera entity.
- Provides three Home Assistant entities:
  - **Camera**: Displays the image with detected errors.
  - **Binary Sensor**: Indicates whether any errors have been detected.
  - **Switch**: Toggles communication with the detection API.

## Installation

1. Install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) (Home Assistant Community Store) if you haven't already.
2. Add this repository to HACS as a custom repository:
   - Go to **HACS** > **Integrations**.
   - Click on the three dots in the upper-right corner and select **Custom repositories**.
   - Enter the URL: `https://github.com/nobodyguy/obico_ml_ha_integration`.
   - Choose **Integration** as the category.
3. Search for **Obico ML** in HACS and install the integration.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

Alternatively, you can manually copy the `obico_ml_ha_integration` folder to your `custom_components` directory.

## Configuration

To configure the integration:

1. Go to **Configuration** > **Integrations** in Home Assistant.
2. Click on the **Add Integration** button.
3. Search for **Obico ML** and click on it to configure.
4. Fill in the configuration parameters.

### Configuration Options

- **API URL**: The URL of the detection backend.
- **Camera Entity**: The camera entity used to capture images for error detection.
- **Detection Interval**: The interval (in seconds) between detection API calls.
- **Detection Threshold**: Optional. The threshold for error detection sensitivity.

## Provided Entities

### Camera

Displays the image with detected 3D printing errors. This camera entity updates periodically based on the detection interval.

### Binary Sensor

A binary sensor that indicates whether any errors have been detected. If errors are found in the image, the sensor will show `on`, otherwise `off`.

### Switch

Allows you to enable or disable the periodic communication with the detection API to save HW resources. When switched off, error detection is paused.

## Example Usage

```yaml
# Example automation for detecting 3D printing failures
automation:
  - alias: "Toggle Obico ML Detection based on Printer State"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.prusalink
    action:
      - choose:
          - conditions:
              - condition: state
                entity_id: sensor.prusalink
                state: "printing"
            sequence:
              - service: switch.turn_on
                target:
                  entity_id: switch.obico_ml_communication
          - conditions:
              - condition: not
                conditions:
                  - condition: state
                    entity_id: sensor.prusalink
                    state: "printing"
            sequence:
              - service: switch.turn_off
                target:
                  entity_id: switch.obico_ml_communication
  - alias: "Notify on 3D printing failure"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.obico_ml_failure_detected
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: notify.notify
        data:
          message: "3D printing failure detected!"
          data:
            image: /api/camera_proxy/camera.obico_ml_detection_camera
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with the integration, check the Home Assistant logs for error messages. Common issues include:

* Camera entity not found: Ensure that the camera entity you configured is available and working.
* API communication issues: Verify that the detection backend is running and reachable by Home Assistant.
